Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js/io.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle. It features solid transaction support, relations, read replication and more.

### Note
sequelize-oracle is a fork of [sequelize@master](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/tree/master) 
this fork add support of DML statements for Oracle  
If you don't need Oracle support, prefer the original [Sequelize](http://sequelizejs.com/)

## Installation

`npm install sequelize-oracle`

From 3.0.0 and up Sequelize will follow SEMVER. 3.0.0 contains important security fixes so we highly recommend that users upgrade.

If you still use 1.7 please prefer to [Upgrading to 2.0](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/wiki/Upgrading-to-2.0) and the changelog between 2.0 and 3.0. 2.1 also has a breaking change.
